## Example Queries for Phase 1 Testing

### Basic Queries:
1. "Show me my bugs"
2. "Items assigned to me"
3. "Work items I created"
4. "All user stories"
5. "High priority items"

### Expected WIQL Output:
```sql
-- "Show me my bugs"
SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [System.State], [System.AssignedTo]
FROM WorkItems 
WHERE [System.WorkItemType] = 'Bug' 
AND [System.AssignedTo] = @Me

-- "Items assigned to me"
SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [System.WorkItemType], [System.State]
FROM WorkItems 
WHERE [System.AssignedTo] = @Me

-- "Work items I created"
SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [System.WorkItemType], [System.CreatedBy]
FROM WorkItems 
WHERE [System.CreatedBy] = @Me
```

## Risk Mitigation for Phase 1

### Technical Risks:
- **ADO DOM Structure Changes**: Implement robust selectors and fallbacks
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement caching and rate limiting
- **Security Concerns**: Validate all inputs, use CSP headers

### Timeline Risks:
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to basic functionality for Phase 1
- **Integration Complexity**: Start with simple DOM manipulation
- **Testing Delays**: Begin testing early and often
